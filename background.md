# What is node JS ?

Front end code runs in the browser, while back end code runs in the server. JS could historically only run in the browser. Now, node lets us run code on the server side.

Computers cannot directly understand JS/compile it into machine code, since it is one more level of abstraction compared to other languages like C++. We can't run JS directly on a computer, but it can run inside a browser using the V8 engine which is written in C++.  V8 compiles JS into machine code. 

Outside the browser there is no V8 engine, this is where node comes in.
